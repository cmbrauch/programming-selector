  <p>Welcome! I'm excited to hear about your interest into the world of Computer Programming. At first glance, 
    the amount of different coding languages and information available can be quite daunting. But have no fear! 
    I will be offering you different explanations of a few different languages, and then I will ask you a few 
    questions which will make it a little easier in deciding which is best for you.
